# AEO Tracker Frontend Visual Overhaul Plan

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Create a visually stunning, modern frontend representation of the existing AEO Tracker tool while preserving all backend functionality.

**Approach**: Complete frontend redesign using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and modern UI libraries to transform the current functional interface into a visually stunning, user-friendly experience.

## 1. Current UX Flow Analysis

### High-Level User Journey Mapping
The application follows this core flow:
1. **Landing Page** (`/`) → Embedded AuthForm
2. **Authentication** (Supabase) → Redirect to `/dashboard`
3. **Brand Setup** → Create/select Brand List, add Brands
4. **Query Execution** → Build query, choose models, run
5. **Results & Analytics** → View results, switch to Analytics tab
6. **Settings Discovery** → Profile/API keys only discovered when queries fail

### Deep-Graph Entity Relationships
```
USER → (owns) BRAND LISTS → (contain) BRANDS  
USER → QUERIES → RUNS → MENTIONS (brand ↔ model)  
USER → API KEYS  
```

Most user journeys touch every node, making friction anywhere detrimental to user experience.

### Critical Friction Points Identified

#### 1. **Empty State Overload**
- Blank states dominate (empty lists, no brands, no data)
- No immediate value demonstration for new users
- Overwhelming first-time experience

#### 2. **Blocked Query Flow**
- "Run query" blocked if brand list/brands missing
- Early drop-off due to setup requirements
- No clear guidance on next steps

#### 3. **Dashboard Complexity**
- Single dashboard component exceeds 500 lines
- Information dense analytics without progressive disclosure
- No clear hierarchy or visual organization

#### 4. **Navigation Issues**
- No global navigation system
- Settings/Profile hidden until errors occur
- No breadcrumbs or clear location indicators

#### 5. **Poor Feedback Systems**
- No progress indicators during query execution
- Error handling relies on intrusive `alert()` dialogs
- No streaming logs or real-time updates

#### 6. **Accessibility Gaps**
- Inconsistent color contrast
- Missing focus states
- No keyboard navigation support
- Touch targets may be too small

## 2. North-Star Metric & Success Criteria

### Primary Metric
**Number of successful queries run per weekly active user**

### Key Diagnostic Metrics (AARRR Framework)
- **Acquisition** – Signup conversion rate
- **Activation** – % new users who complete first successful query
- **Referral** – Shared report links / invite sends per user

## 3. Comprehensive Redesign Recommendations

### A. Foundational UX Architecture

#### 1. Information Architecture
- **Global Navigation Bar** (left sidebar or top bar):
  - Home │ Queries │ Analytics │ Brand Lists │ Settings
- **Persistent Status Indicators**:
  - API key status with tooltip ("API keys missing")
  - Universal Brand List dropdown in toolbar
  - Cascading selection across all pages

#### 2. Landing Page Complete Product Demo
- **Full Product Experience**: Complete search and analytics demo on landing page
- **Interactive Search**: Users can run real searches with their own queries
- **Full Results Display**: Complete AI model responses with brand highlighting
- **Analytics Dashboard Preview**: Show 4-5 key metrics (mentions, rankings, top brand, model comparison, trends)
- **Conversion Optimization**: "Sign up to save your results and track over time" CTA
- **Beautiful Animation**: Smooth transitions and loading states for complete demo experience

#### 3. Onboarding & Empty States
- **Auto-Creation**: Default Brand List ("My Brands") during signup
- **Demo Content**: Seed with example brands + sample query (marked as "example")
- **Immediate Value**: Show results immediately, even with demo data
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Replace alerts with non-blocking inline banners
- **Step-by-Step Checklist**:
  ① Verify email → ② Add first brand → ③ Run first query → ④ View analytics

#### 3. Query Builder Redesign
- **Dedicated Page** (`/queries/new`) or modal wizard:
  - Step 1: Select Brand List (pre-filled)
  - Step 2: Write/choose query template (with autocomplete)
  - Step 3: Pick AI models (toggle chips)
- **Live Feedback**: Character count & cost estimator
- **Async Processing**: Progress bar with streaming logs (SSE/WebSocket)
- **Results Page**: Highlight deltas between models, sortable columns

#### 4. Analytics Dashboard Restructure
- **Executive Summary First**: Single-screen overview with key metrics
  - Cards: Mentions ↑8%, Top Brand, Fastest Growing, Model Comparison, Trend Analysis
- **Landing Page Preview**: 4-5 core metrics displayed in beautiful dashboard preview
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Tabs for deep dives (Brands, Models, Queries, Competitive)
- **Insight Callouts**: Surface patterns ("Gemini favors Brand X 2× vs ChatGPT")
- **Export & Share**: One-click export (PNG/CSV) and shareable public links

#### 5. Visual & Interaction Design
- **Design System**: Adopt ShadCN or Radix UI + Tailwind CSS tokens
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA contrast, responsive touch targets (≥44×44px)
- **Clarity**: Replace icon-only buttons with label-plus-icon
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders during API fetches
- **Consistent Spacing**: Enforce type scale and spacing system

#### 6. Accessibility & Internationalization
- **Keyboard Support**: Full navigation with focus rings and skip-links
- **Screen Readers**: ARIA live regions for job progress
- **Multilingual**: Maintain Spanish support (`lang="es"`), consider bilingual content

### B. Growth Engineering Enhancements

#### 1. Acquisition Optimization
- **Complete Product Demo**: Full search and analytics experience on landing page
- **SEO Strategy**: Marketing site with keyword "AI SEO tracking"
- **Content Marketing**: Blog and case studies

- **Referral Program**: +10 free queries for each invited user

#### 2. Activation Improvements
- **Product Tour**: Tooltip library (Shepherd.js) triggered after signup
- **Success Metrics**: Track completion of onboarding checklist
- **Immediate Value**: Demo results visible within 30 seconds
